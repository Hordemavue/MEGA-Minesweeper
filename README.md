# MEGA-Minesweeper

Not Minesweeper, MEGA-Minesweeper !!! The same game but numbers dont indicate the number on the 8 surrounding cells (3x3 square -1, the center) but the 24 surrounding cells (5x5 -1, the center) !! NO, YOU ARE NOT DREAMING, THATS MEGA-MINESWEEPER !!! 

## ðŸš€ Features 

**For the moment, to change in code, line 5 to 13 :**
- **GRID_WIDTH and GRID_HEIGHT:** To change the size of the grid.
- **NB_BOMBS:** To change the number of the bomb.
- **RANGE_FIRST_CLICK:** Bombs are never placed within a square radius around the first click. (I recommand at least 2, 3 should be better, more is too much)
- **SHOW_MILLISECONDS:** To have a better information about the timer.
- **ACTIVATE_FLASH_LIGHT:** To see which case influence the number where you just click at.
- **AUTO_CLICK_ON_NUMBER:** An Auto Reveal. Click on a number with the correct number of flags to auto-reveal surrounding cells.
